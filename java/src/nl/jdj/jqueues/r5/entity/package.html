    <div>A package for simulation of queueing systems.
      <p>
        In the package, we use three important concepts:
      <ul>
        <li>Jobs (<code>interface SimJob</code>): a job represents an amount of work to be carried out by one or more queueing
            systems, abbreviated as queues;
        <li>Queues (<code>interface SimQueue</code>): a queue is an abstract waiting line holding jobs
            to be served by one or more servers associated with the queue;
        <li>Entities (<code>interface SimEntity</code>):
            the common part of jobs and queues (naming, event list, notifications, etc).
      </ul>
      The so-called queue discipline determines in what order jobs are served by the server(s).
      <p>
        Notes:
      <ul>
        <li>This package depends on the <code>jsimulation</code> package.
        <li>This package focuses exclusively on modeling and simulation of the queueing systems themselves;
            it currently does not feature adequate random-number and stochastic-process generation
            and only basic statistics
            (mostly because we believe there are extremely good Java libraries for that already).
        <li>This top-level package contains the essential interfaces of a simulation entity,
            and a partial implementation. The sub-packages contain extensions to the basis entity interfaces (including for
            jobs and queues), and (concrete) implementations.
      </ul>
