    <div>A small package for simulation of queueing systems.
      <p>
        It uses two important concepts:
      <ul>
        <li>Jobs (<code>interface SimJob</code>): a job represents an amount of work to be carried out by one or more servers
        <li>Queues (<code>interface SimQueue</code>): a queue is an abstract waiting line holding jobs
          to be served by one or more servers associated with the queue
      </ul>
      The so-called queue discipline determines in what order jobs are served by the server(s).
      <p>
        An important class of queueing disciplines are the non-preemptive ones, in which jobs, once taken into service,
        cannot be preempted (and, for instance, later resumed) in favor of another job.
