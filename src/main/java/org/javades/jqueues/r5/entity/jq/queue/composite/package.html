    <div>Composite queues consist of a fixed set of other, "embedded", queues also known as <i>sub-queues</i>.
         A composite queue's behavior is determined by (1) how a visiting job to the composite queue
           is routed through the embedded queues, and (2) the requested service times at the embedded queues.
